## Heart Disease EDA & Modelling

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling of heart disease data. The primary goal is to analyze various health-related attributes to understand their correlation with heart disease and to build machine learning models to predict the presence of heart disease based on these attributes.

### Project Structure

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**
    
    - Load the dataset and perform basic cleaning.
    - Handle missing values and perform any necessary preprocessing.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    
    - Visualize the distribution of various attributes.
    - Analyze the correlations between attributes and heart disease.
3. **Feature Engineering**
    
    - Create new features if necessary.
    - Encode categorical variables and scale numerical features.
4. **Model Building**
    
    - Split the data into training and testing sets.
    - Train multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and Naive Bayes.
    - Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics.
5. **Model Evaluation**
    
    - Compare models based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
    - Select the best-performing model for final prediction.
